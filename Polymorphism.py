# Four pillars of Object Oriented Programming
# Polymorphism
# Method polymorphism
## When a method is behaving differently depending on the data or number of parameters passed to it
### Overload method

# Inheritance polymorphism
## When a sub class can take the place of its super class and respond to message call
### Override method
